      "body": "<h3>Jealousy: where does it come from and how be with it?</h3> <p>Why does someone calmly let go of a partner to meet with friends, and someone rolls up the stage because of the likes on Facebook? How is ordinary jealousy different from neurotic jealousy? And what if the thoughts of infidelity of the partner become obsessive? We understand where jealousy comes from and how to deal with it.</p> <h3><br />Healthy jealousy</h3> <p><br />Jealousy is more or less familiar to everyone, because everyone experiences the experience of childhood rejection. In preschool we learn that it is impossible to marry mom or marry dad, we face the fact that brother or sister is given more attention. Such discoveries cause resentment and anger at the alleged opponent, sometimes guilt for the fact that you could have done something for which you fell out of love. This early experience contributes to the formation of ordinary jealousy. We are jealous because we have already faced rejection and are afraid to go through it again.</p> <h3><br />Unhealthy jealousy: incomplete separation</h3> <p><br />In a normal situation, parents make it clear that, although you can not be a partner of mom or dad, you can grow up and start a family. If the parent's orbit is so long that it is impossible to separate, a person can feel like a baby all his life. With a partner, he will experience the same feelings as with his parents: he is too young to be taken seriously, and so on.<br />Jealousy returns if you can't get out of the child-parent relationship and feel like an adult.</p>",
